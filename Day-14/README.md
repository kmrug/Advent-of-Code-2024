# üéÑ Day 14: Restroom Redoubt

## üìú Problem Description

While trying to reach the bathroom at **Easter Bunny Headquarters**, you're confronted with a new security obstacle: **teleporting robots** patrolling the tiled floor.

Each robot is defined by:

- A **starting position**: `p=x,y`
- A **velocity**: `v=dx,dy`

The robots move in **straight lines**, and when they hit the edge of the space (101x103 tiles), they **wrap around** like a toroidal grid.

## Part 1: Predict Robot Positions After 100 Seconds

After simulating 100 seconds of motion:

- Robots wrap around if they exceed map boundaries.
- Robots can share the same tile.

You must:
- **Track the number of robots** in each quadrant.
- Multiply the robot counts of all four quadrants to get the **safety factor**.

### Example Input

```
p=0,4 v=3,-3
p=6,3 v=-1,-3
p=10,3 v=-1,2
p=2,0 v=2,-1
p=0,0 v=1,3
p=3,0 v=-2,-2
p=7,6 v=-1,-3
p=3,0 v=-1,-2
p=9,3 v=2,3
p=7,3 v=-1,2
p=2,4 v=2,-3
p=9,5 v=-3,-3
```

After 100 seconds, compute the robots per tile and derive quadrant counts:

| Quadrant | Robot Count |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Q1       | 1           |
| Q2       | 3           |
| Q3       | 4           |
| Q4       | 1           |

‚úÖ Safety Factor = `1 √ó 3 √ó 4 √ó 1 = 12`

## Part 2: Find the Christmas Tree Easter Egg

You're told the robots may **form a hidden image** when aligned at a special moment (like a **Christmas tree**).

You must:
- Find the **minimum number of seconds** needed for robots to align visibly.
- Detect visual patterns (usually when bounding box height/width is minimized).

### Hint Strategy
- Track bounding box area over time.
- Stop when robot arrangement becomes visually **stable and compact**.

---

## üîë Key Observations

- Robot motion follows:  

newX = `(startX + dx * seconds) % WIDTH`
newY = `(startY + dy * seconds) % HEIGHT`

- Wrapping ensures no robot leaves the map.
- In Part 2, the answer isn't a number you can solve mathematically‚Äîyou must **observe patterns over time**.

## üß† Approach

### Part 1:

1. Parse each robot's position and velocity.
2. For each robot:
 - Calculate final position after 100 seconds using modular arithmetic.
3. Count robots in each quadrant (excluding midlines).
4. Return the product of the four quadrant counts.

### Part 2:

1. Simulate movement over time.
2. Track the **bounding box** of all robots at each time step.
3. When bounding box area starts increasing, stop:
 - Visual pattern (Christmas tree) appears at the **smallest bounding box**.
4. Return the number of seconds elapsed.
